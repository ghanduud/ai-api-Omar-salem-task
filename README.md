# 🚀 AI-Integrated Spaceship Game

## 🎮 Project Overview

This game features an **AI-driven voice control system** that allows players to control a spaceship using their microphone. The player assumes the role of the **captain**, issuing commands to their ship and interacting with an **AI crew member** for responses.

## 📂 Scene Location

To access the correct scene, navigate to:

```
Assets\Omar Mohamed\_AI Integration using API\Local\FunctionCall\Exercise
```

## 🛠️ Features

- **Voice-Controlled Spaceship**: Players can command the spaceship using voice inputs.
- **AI Crew Interaction**: Communicate with an AI crew member for responses and guidance.
- **Dynamic Actions**: The spaceship can perform the following actions:
  - 🔫 **Shoot**
  - ❤️ **Heal**
  - ⬅️ **Move Left**
  - ➡️ **Move Right**
  - 🛡️ **Activate/Deactivate Shield**

## 🎤 How It Works

1. Press the **record button** to issue a voice command.
2. The AI transcribes the command and determines the best action.
3. If the command is related to the ship, it executes the action.
4. If the command is a general question, the AI crew member responds accordingly.

This AI-powered system enhances immersion by allowing **natural language interaction** with the spaceship and its crew. 🚀
